# Component Design

- **Small and focused** — one component, one responsibility. Split when logic exceeds ~80 lines or JSX ~100 lines.
- **Naming** — name after what it represents (e.g. `PostCard`), not appearance (`CardWithShadow`).
- **Imports** — use the `@/` path alias for components, hooks, lib, and types (e.g. `import { X } from "@/components/..."`), not relative paths like `../../`.
- **No raw API in components** — always use a custom hook for data/API.
- **Reuse** — if the same markup appears in more than one place, extract it into its own component.
- **Separation** — split layout/structural components from logic (e.g. `PostList` for layout, `usePosts` for data).
- **Data flow** — pass data down via props, communicate up via callbacks. Keep it explicit and traceable.
- **Avoid prop drilling** — if passing props more than 2 levels deep, lift state up or use a custom hook.
- **Shared data** — if multiple components need the same data, lift state to the nearest common parent.
- **Custom hooks** — prefix with `use` (e.g. `useAuth`, `usePosts`) and place in `hooks/`.
