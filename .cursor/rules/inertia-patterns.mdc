# Inertia Patterns

- **Pages** — live in `resources/js/Pages/` and are the only components that receive Inertia props directly.
- **Lean pages** — keep Page components thin; move logic into hooks and UI into smaller components.
- **Prefer server data** — never fetch client-side what the controller can pass via Inertia props.
- **usePage** — use only in Page components or in dedicated hooks that wrap it, not deep in the tree.
- **Shared data** — access auth, flash messages, etc. via a dedicated hook that wraps `usePage`, not by calling `usePage` in many places.
